To be honest, hell is no longer fresh. You and I have been circling the drain for two years now. Just going around in endless circles, waiting to be dropped down the gurgling hole in the middle. Except, this hole is actually a concentric circle of holes and you just keep moving down the ladder of despair. While uncomfortable, waiting is still easy. Some of us haven't been that lucky. 

If you too are a card-carrying cynic, 2021 was another landmark year. The Pantone color of the year was despair[^1]. We have inherited a [raging wildfire](https://twitter.com/doppelhanger/status/1373305423323750404) and we would just like to tell everyone that we did not start it but we knew this would happen. Never have I ever wanted so badly to be proven wrong by literally everything. 


##### What Did We Do Before?


I hear the phrase "back to normal" and I really don't know if there is anything normal to go back to. Was there ever? Imagine if you went to a dinner party and the rug in the kitchen had a giant slowly spreading dark red stain in the middle and you ignored it completely and complimented the host for their taste in rugs. That would be going "back to normal." 

What was normal? The definition for most people seems to be doing things outside of a residence and around other people. Of course, the things themselves were always a proxy for the human contact and experiences that they provided. If this has always been a mainstay of Life for you, and it is, for many, you are understandably distraught. You took the precautions, for your safety and also for others' safety, and you did your part and now you are being told "Get back in there! The war is not over!" If you took precautions in the name of the greater good, this betrayal by our cavalier ilk stings a lot. I think a lot of us are hurt more by the knowledge that nothing we could do would have been enough. We did our best to be "good" but that was barely a drop in the ocean[^2]. 

I have always been a fan of the great indoors but I surprised myself with how well I adapted to the Present. I was forced to accept long ago that "I did nothing today" is a good thing and I suggest you do the same. Welcome to Life as many others, the immunocompromised for example, have known forever. I am lucky for having moved through the last two years relatively unscathed. Not everyone can work from home. Yes, there have been the occasional scares and the countless sleepless nights and the regularly scheduled reminders of mortality and the unshakeable feeling that every new notification on my phone must bear ill tidings and the general feeling of helplessness due to being oceans away from my parents. But, apart from that, my personal and professional life remains largely unaffected. The elderly, and the working class have suffered more. The developing world had it worse and still does. If you had thought you could build an ark and live out this flood, you need to discard that illusion. You will continue to see sight of the shore routinely but be cautious. Landfall is a distant possibility. 


##### What Now?

A new untapped source of despair for many of us has been the realization that our systems failed. Who or what do we blame for this? The machine that just won't be stopped, the epistemological rot that shadows the "news", the haves, our collective inability to envision a different path forward, the gulf between what we know and what we actually do, the usual suspects. 

The end-of-year holidays bring a new localized source of despair. I am an immigrant in [America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Pq98n2j75XA) and like many other immigrants, the holidays have always been about missing home. For many, this will be another year when they are forced to deal with this feeling. I think the deeper underlying sadness that will affect us all is the feeling of lost time and of progress not made. No one likes being on a treadmill forever. 

A lot has changed but there hasn't been a sweeping transformative change in our way of life that some of us hoped for. The persistent "Life is short" reminders, along with the general lack of meaning in most things we call work and the deplorable state of working conditions led to a lot of people quitting jobs. The general lack of systemic justice has helped scale citizen courts in social media. Our inability to envision a future reflects the re-emergence of the past in design. Repackaging nostalgia is not just viable due to the safety of familiarity but also due to the waves of burnout that are hitting both creators and consumers. Catching glimpse of a chin feels like a forbidden act now. We have all lost something, on some level, even though it may not look like or feel like the kind of loss that you are familiar with. The immense loss of life might be the most tangible but having to go to school via Zoom is also a loss. 

I understand that the goal is now to turn the pandemic to endemic. But I have also seen an year's worth of inaction, in the face of knowledge. I had always thought that the fear of death would be enough of a motivator to bring this under control. I was wrong. The virus might eventually become common and linger. But it has done way more damage than we can see. It has exposed the bureaucracy that encloses Science casting doubt on Science itself. Dealing with uncertainty has sapped our ability to care for each other. The glut of information we all receive every day is only going to add to the anxiety. As proverbs go, "no news is good news" has been overworked to exhaustion this year. If you have been trained to fix problems, the abundance of information and the inability to do something constructive with it will only paralyze you further. 

Expecting the circumstances to persist endlessly is a reasonable response. What were we doing before? Just more of the same. Everything is worse and apparently it has always been worse. What we are getting is a lot of practice with reminders that it never ends. 

It is easy to conclude that nothing ever will change which is why you must choose the hard path. Maybe do it as reverse psychology on the Inevitable. Maybe do it because years of reading has taught you that resistance is charming. Maybe do it because despair isn't often a persistent feeling and at some point it congeals into fear and hope and maybe we have some power over which form it chooses. 

I don't know. I truly don't know and I don't like not knowing. There is nothing that bothers me as much as the lack of a clear answer. I know that I must keep looking for an answer. It is the least I can do. It is perhaps the only thing I can do. I was forced to confront the acute pain of reality when I was thirteen. Like most bildungsroman[^3] protagonists, I found that the only way to get through Life was by resenting it. I have thankfully worked myself out of that notion but it took at least thirteen more years to do that. I don't expect an answer out of our current predicament to arrive immediately. I have spent a considerable time advocating against positive thinking as a crutch and the cult of productivity it inspires. Consequently, Life not being "good" is not a surprise for me and I suspect there are several like me. If you are a new entrant to the club, know that the seats are uncomfortable and the view is unsatisfactory. Everyone in here loves pointing out the "true" nature of reality. We really need to invite the Escapists to attend the club meetings. Is that the answer then: telling each other stories? 

##### Brazil

In Brazil (1985), there is a scene where the protagonist's boss has secret cameras in his office (in the Ministry of Information) and he can see that all his workers are watching Casablanca. He opens his office door to investigate and sees everyone hard at work. The workers respond to a meaningless job by resisting productivity. The system continues unharmed. 

The protagonist, Sam Lowry, is a valuable employee of the Ministry. He has repeatedly denied promotion even though he is very good at his excessively dull job. He has a domineering mother who tells him what to do and even though, he lives on his own he is barely an adult. He is, in fact, an overgrown boy who fantasizes a different reality, complete with a dream girl. This fantasy of idealized romantic love with cinematic obstacles allows him to believe that he is "resisting" while continuing to be a cog in the system. Sam Lowry is not the hero of this tale[^4]. 

His dream girl, Jill, and mysterious guerilla plumber, Harry Tuttle, are better candidates for heroes. Jill cares about people and asks questions that provoke Sam to finally stop drinking the kool aid. Tuttle ignores the bureaucracy to focus on solving problems directly. He fixes Sam's heating problem despite the absence of the now-famous form "27 b stroke 6." Tuttle's approach leads Sam to get into more trouble. Both Jill and Tuttle come close to resisting the system but both eventually fail. The system is adept at neutralizing individual resistance. Ultimately, the film points out that "escape" is not a [solution](https://twitter.com/doppelhanger/status/1298861812247486464). Sam's dreams are largely ineffectual but the fantasies they represent are not. In an incredibly dark (literally and metaphorically) world, they are the only instances of light breaking through[^6].

[^1]: Well one of them was something called [Ultimate Gray](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2021). Need I say more? 

[^2]: Every disaster movie ever taught me that "bad people" would stop doing "bad things" because of a global emergency. Is that not how it works? 

[^3]: Alright, Young Adult fiction.
 
[^4]: Brazil is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, I recognize that its message might not translate well from screen to audience due to the multiple layers of symbolism (and also the possibility that the creator did not bake any message into those layers). It is unlikely that everyone who watches the movie takes away the same message. Conservatives in UK and the far right in America love the movie and I suspect for the wrong reasons. However, I think there is one thing that everyone can relate with: late capitalism, its dehumanizing effects, and the individual struggle to cope. 

[^5]: This might be spoiler territory so be warned etc. Sam does end up in what might be called a "happy ending" which looks suspiciously like one of the billboards we saw earlier. However, I believe the point being made is that the escape route is circular. "Love conquers all" will not provide an easy answer here. Does Sam escape? On some level, yes but that version of escape is akin to insanity. This is the risk of nostalgia as a Ghost of Morality Past, a call for the "good ol' times." It becomes co-opted as a marketing channel, a new way to sell.
