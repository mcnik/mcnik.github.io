title: Do I Make New Year Resolutions?
---

It was sunny outside and the light and heat made me forget that it was cold and windy too. I was walking. I walked past people with long, drooping faces. They turned to look at me as I passed by them. They are baffled by my upbeat attitude, my "walking-on-a-cloud" gait, my luminescent aura, and the big grin plastered on my face. Some of the people who passed me by ask me, "Why are you smiling?" They say, scandalized, "Are you happy?" They asked, "What is your secret?" I don't say anything. I just kept walking. I will tell them but first I need to let you know. As I write this, a new year has begun. It is the First of January, Two Thousand Twenty Two. I am happy because I have discovered the secret to happiness. I have also discovered the secret to time travel but that one's less important[^1]. 

First, I can't tell you anything of material importance because I cannot have you trying to change the past[^2]. For example, I can't tell you to stop studying for med school because you don't really want to become a doctor. I definitely can't tell you to buy Amazon stock. Why does the river in South America have stock? Don't worry about it. I can tell you that you no longer wield your self-deprecation as a crutch but you still use it as a shield. You've lost weight, a lot of it. You can cook very well which will come as an immense relief as you clean the kitchen after the pressure cooker blows some day. Your strategy of not wanting friends has worked wonders and you now have good friends. They say nice things about you even when you aren't in the room. Trust me[^3]. 

You have warm slippers. Your feet are cold. They are always so cold. People have told you that. You bought the slippers from Amazon and frankly, you regret not buying them sooner. They are comfortable and they make your feet feel like they are being snuggled by warm puppy noses. I am sure you are walking around barefoot right now saying that the cold never bothered you anyway[^4]. Unlike the slippers, your work is not that important. 

You are probably dreaming right now of writing a story. You think of yourself as a magical creature, a fluffy Unicorn, in a land of stories. You write a lot but you like almost none of it. You know that you write because you are simply compelled to tell a story. A story that will take everything that you know about the world, which is not much, and build a bridge between you and the rest of Humanity. You did not do that. You can not do that. 

You have a job that you like, though you won't admit it. It doesn't involve writing or what you might call "being creative." You are good at it. People tell you that and they don't really have a reason to lie because you aren't even that nice to them. I know you hate the idea of people management but people like you and you can motivate them and get them to work together. You have become better at sharing. You write when you can and you hate almost none of it. You somehow know more and yet, less about the World. It is more broken than you always suspected it to be. Dogs continue to love you and cats have warmed up to you. 

Your friends ask you questions about things that you can't answer. You understand now that "what do I know" while honest is not always helpful. You use words to fashion a crude splint and hope that you have helped. People find you funny and likeable. As far as you can tell, by doing what you like and trying, often failing, to be good, you have managed to find good people. This might be the accomplishment you should be proud of. Well, there are other things to be proud of but you still don't like bragging[^5]. 

You will be glad to know that you still have that urge in you to create. Your tools haven't rusted and your muscles haven't withered. You have a better sense of what you are capable of creating and what it means to the audience. Don't be so hard on yourself[^6]. Trite, banal, "heard it before," I can hear you say. I hate to admit it but it is true and simple, like most truths in Life. There are ups and downs. Only death is perfect. 

Don't assume that only you can see the World for what it is. For two years, people like you have paid the price of goods ordered by someone else. People have been forced to see it daily for two years now. They don't need reminders. Show them the world as it can be or better, as it should be. The Universe does not get cable and so is incapable of understanding Irony[^7]. 

You haven't gotten the better of all your insecurities yet but you know where they all live. You are not a fluffy Unicorn; you are a brown Raccoon, scavenging for scraps and getting good at it. You have never taken happiness for granted and that will serve you well. 

Try to relax. Things happen with and without you. Even the minotaur had moments of peace in the labyrinth.

[^1]: You got me, they are the same thing!

[^2]: All letters from future-selves are highly regulated and rigorously checked by the redacted. So, I can't tell you any of the really important stuff about our life. Yes, you still like Doctor Who. You can grow facial hair. You have been using contact lenses and you are even getting your teeth corrected with braces. Your opinions on things have changed but please don't term this a 'betrayal.' It just means you are capable of change which is a badge of honor in these times. I could tell you what tweets went viral so you can tweet them instead but we both know all we will get is 1 retweet and 1 like. 

[^3]: "If you could go back in time would you rather try to change the course of history or spy on conversations when you are not in the room?" should be on the Voight-Kampff test.

[^4]: Three years later, Elsa will say that and the whole world will go crazy. Who's Elsa? Doesn't matter.

[^5]: You went up on a stage and told jokes and people laughed. It wasn't art but it was entertaining and sometimes that is enough. Also, don't drink Dr Pepper. It will pay off in ten years.

[^6]: No, you don't work as the Line Supervisor at the Cliche Factory.

[^7]: Getting warm slippers doesn't mean you will get frostbite at some point.
