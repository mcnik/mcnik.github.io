title: What Is Cinema?
---

Imagine going to the fanciest restaurant (you can imagine) for an expensive dinner. You've been told by several famous food critics and chefs that this is one of the greatest restaurants ever. The service is a bit slow and you end up sitting there for three hours. The food is great, the ingredients are timeless, their arrangement is familiar but still new. Yet, you wonder if you lack the requisite amount of taste buds to truly appreciate the effort. You feel sated when you leave but you don't feel like you've left with the same life you sat down with. 

The next day, you eat McDonalds for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

I watched [No Sudden Move](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/), [Greenland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7737786/), [Freaky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919380/), and [A Quiet Place 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8332922/) all in the span of a week. Before that, I had watched [The Leopard](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-leopard-1963).

While watching the Quiet Place sequel (entertaining but unnecessary), I realized why I could not bring myself to care about the fate of the Abbott family. The stakes were not real enough. There simply wasn't enough uncertainty in the narrative for me to be invested in what happens next. I was going through the motions, waiting the clock out. I thought back to the three other movies I had watched earlier in the week. While No Sudden Move benefits from the stylings of a certain Mr. Soderbergh, it is still a movie devoid of uncertainty. With Greenland, I made the mistake of judging a disaster movie by the actors on its poster. The movie builds suspense well and there is a moment in the first half where I wasn't sure what was going to happen. My friend pointed out that a sequel was already being considered taking all air out of my flagging interest. Freaky is Freaky Friday the 13th which is not surprising when you find out that it was made by the same mind that made Groundhog Day but serial killer.
