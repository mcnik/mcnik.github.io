title: Why Must The Trolley Run?
---

The trolley problem is a classic. You are out on your own. You are waiting for the train to pass so you can get across the street and continue having a good time. You have always been a fan of trains so you can't wait to see what this one looks like. But wait, something is wrong. You notice there are five people tied to the tracks. A trolley, seemingly self-propelled, suddenly appears and guess what, it is headed straight for them. You see another person tied to a different parallel set of tracks. You look around and spot a lever right next to you. You know, instinctively, that pulling this lever will save the five people and kill the one person on the other track.

What kind of sicko goes around tying people to tracks? How did this person even find, abduct, and tie up 6 people in broad daylight? Did no one else see this happen? Why did they not do anything? Why are you here? Where are you supposed to go next? These are some of the questions that don't appear in your mind. The only question that does appear in your mind is this: What is the right thing to do?

Wait, but how did you get here? You can't remember what you were doing before you ended up here, can you? Did you also get abducted by the same sicko? Who else would put you in such an ethical conundrum? Isn't there any easier way to teach the difference between utilitarianism and deontological approaches? What would you do?

There is only one possible way not to lose a game: never play it. By choosing to sacrifice anyone, you are ultimately making a choice to participate in this obtuse game. By choosing to participate, you are accepting the rules laid down by the invisible Jigsaw-style ethicist-serial killer who designed the game in the first place.

Maybe the trolley problem is just another way for Big Trolley to shift responsibility to the individual in the name of "ethics." 

If your Trolley Engineering team is set the goal of achieving maximum operational efficiency at hitting the trolley switch, they will work on that problem. How will they measure their success? By the number of decisions made to switch the trolley. Not by the number of people saved or the number of runaway trolleys stopped completely.

Why must we accept that the individual needs to pull the switch? Why is there no switch to stop the runaway trolley? Even in an exaggerated metaphorical interpretation, like this one, the question must be asked. Does the trolley symbolize rampant runaway capitalism? Framing a decision here as a binary (save or kill people) causes us to view it as an unavoidable choice. "How do I stop the trolley?" is the question to ask. You might save five people or you might save one person now but you must make sure that no one else has to ever make this terrible choice.

Of course, a better world is possible.
