### About this

Honestly, I don't know if I have a good answer. Sometime before Twitter, I was what might be termed an "avid blogger." The quality of the blogging was dismal, the intent behind it was muddled and there was no validation to be found. Then came Twitter. I've been on Twitter for ten years now and both I and the platform have changed. This is an attempt to think beyond a tweet. 

This is an attempt to answer the question: How do I know what I believe in? By writing those beliefs out and seeing if they make sense. I need a place to burnish my thoughts so I can be sure of them. By attempting to construct a coherent paragraph or two, I am hoping to find the one sentence that encapsulates my belief. Plus, I get some writing done and don't feel bad about myself for not getting writing done. 

This is an attempt at growth. Am I capable of having opinions on things and updating those opinions over time? This is hosted in Github so there is a history of changes. Some of these posts have been already edited several times because I found myself editing myself. Dissent and confirmation are both equally valid products of this exercise. 

I have a tendency to be covetous of some sentences. I am also risk averse as are all who fear failure. Lately, I have noticed that I am more comfortable with being wrong. This is an attempt at being profligate. 

This is not an attempt to be "good" or "right" or "essential" or "moral." I just know that I need to write.
