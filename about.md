### About this

My previous attempt at blogging was unsatisfying, to put it mildly. The intent behind it was muddled and there was no validation to be found. Then came Twitter. This is an attempt to articulate thoughts beyond a tweet. 

By writing those thoughts out and seeing if they make sense, I want to see if I can triangulate some beliefs. I needed a place to burnish my thoughts so I can be sure of them. Plus, I get some writing done and don't feel bad about myself for not getting writing done. 

Am I capable of having opinions on things and updating those opinions over time? Some of these posts have been already edited several times because I disagreed with what I had written down. Dissent and confirmation are both equally valid products of this exercise. 

I have a tendency to be covetous of my output. I am also risk averse so profligacy does not come naturally. Lately, I have noticed that I am more comfortable with being wrong. 

This is not an attempt to be "good" or "right" or "essential" or "moral." 

Pretentious? Yes. Self-absorbed? Maybe. Wankery? Calm down.

I just know that I need to write.
