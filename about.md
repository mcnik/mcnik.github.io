### About this

Honestly, I don't know if I have a good answer. Sometime before Twitter, I was what might be termed an "avid blogger." The quality of the blog was dismal and the intent behind it was muddled. Twitter came in and scratched a very particular need well. It was easy to constrain my thoughts and have them be validated by a thousand people. Recently, I've noticed myself constructing longer elaborate sentences while talking to myself and also while I attempt to talk to others. I've come to a conclusion: Twitter is not a great place for a conversation. 

This is an attempt to have a conversation with myself. 

This is an attempt to answer the question: How do I know what I believe in? By writing those beliefs out and seeing if they make sense. By attempting to construct a coherent paragraph or two, I am hoping to find the one sentence that encapsulates my belief. Plus, I get some writing done and don't feel bad about myself for not getting writing done. 

I have a tendency to be covetous of some sentences. Sometimes, I will take a shower and a wonderful sentence will pop into my head. I will make a note of it and then I will forget about it. I will not want to use it anywhere because I like it too much to put it out into the world. This is an attempt at being profligate. 

This is an attempt at growth. Am I capable of having opinions on things and updating those opinions over time? This is hosted in Github so there is a history of changes. Some of these posts have been already edited several times because I found myself disagreeing with what I had written down. Dissent and confirmation are both equally valid products of this exercise.

This is an attempt to think beyond a tweet. I often have thoughts and ideas about things that lead to "discourse" on Twitter. I almost never weigh in and if I do, it is with a tweet. Often, I have the beginnings of an idea that I would like to test or a thought that I would like to burnish. I need a place to write down my thoughts so I can be sure of them. It is a difficult game though because I risk compounding confirmation bias. I could also invite dissent and who knows what shape that might take. 

I am also risk averse as are all who fear failure. Lately, I have noticed an annoyance with waiting to be wrong. This is an attempt at being wrong now. 

And, yes, there is definitely better writing, on probably all of these topics, out there. I am not saying that the things I am saying here are good or right or "morally unassailable." All I'm saying is that I need to say them.
