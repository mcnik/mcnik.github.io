### Why

An overarching theme in these photos is that of emptiness. 

### The photos

#### Cover Photo: Tower Bridge, Sacramento, CA | July 4 2021
![Tower Bridge, Sacramento, CA](/imgs/2022calendar/cover-sacramento-july42021.jpg?raw=true "Tower Bridge, Sacramento, CA")
One of the rare examples of the Art Deco style being used on a bridge, this bright yellow bridge is hard to miss if you visit California's state capital. I was rather unsure of my skill with the camera, when I was there, and keenly aware that I was running out of film. I remember standing on the ample divider separating busy traffic and waiting with a friend to get the right photo. I remember feeling grateful that I had friends willing to entertain my fancies. I hope the bridge makes a [speedy recovery](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2021/12/22/tower-bridge-broken/). 

January: Cook's Meadow Loop, Yosemite Valley, CA | October 16 2021
![Cook's Meadow Loop, Yosemite Valley, CA](/imgs/2022calendar/january-yosemite-oct162021.jpg?raw=true "Half Dome as seen from Cook's Meadow Loop")
This might be the most accessible hiking trail in the Yosemite Valley. Unless the weather is awful or a meteor has recently struck the planet, you will struggle not to see people around. We found a log and waited long enough to find a rare lull in foot traffic. I have photos without people but I like the Coleridge-like aspect of a single person staring into the mighty unknowable. 

February: Purisima Creek Trail overlooking Half Moon Bay, CA | May 8 2021

An old film camera knows no masters. You get what you get, more or less, and you don't know what you are going to get until you develop the film. This scarcity metric forces you to be more deliberate in choosing what to photograph and also when to photograph. I have shot quite a few rolls of film only to find the end product less than satisfactory. The colors of the sky you see here did not exist in "objective reality." The digital scan was not edited by me. This is the rare instance when the film did something inspired all on its own. 

February: 635 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA | February 21 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/february2-sf-feb212021.jpg?raw=true "A Victorian house being moved")
Do you remember wonder, the kind that induces awe, not desperation? I think to myself wonder is in short supply these days and yet an entire house was moved not too far away from where I live. I got to the house's final resting place after it had arrived there. My roommate joined me and she brought my camera along. A small community formed there and we talked to quite a few people and we all forgot that a deadly pandemic raged elsewhere. 

March: Haight & Buena Vista East, San Francisco, CA | March 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/march-sf-march2021.jpg?raw=true "Golden hour light from Buena Vista Park East")
I live somewhere to the left of the intersection visible in this photo. I have a forty minute walking route that takes me through Buena Vista Park and down. This photo is from one such walk. I take photos with my phone going up and down the route and yet none of them is as languourous as this one. Encased in amber, I will always remember my time here fondly. A photo like this makes one realize the unique charms of shooting with film. 

April: "Monumental Reckoning" & SkyStar Wheel, San Francisco, CA | July 16 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/april1-sf-jul162021.jpg?raw=true "The Wheel of Misfortune")
I went here specifically to get photos of the ferris wheel. When I walked around, I discovered something much deeper, a monument to America's legacy of slavery. The history of this country, as perhaps all countries, is often considered more important than the history of the many people that make it. This leads to attempts to erase certain parts in the hope that the whole might come off untarnished. The last two years have taught me this, at least. "Monumental Reckoning," the name couldn't be more apt. [more](https://www.monumentalreckoning.org/)

April: "Duck" on Stow Lake, San Francisco, CA | July 17 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/april2-sf-july172021.jpg?raw=true "Duck")
I love contradictions. If I could I would have put two photos on each page, comparing and contrasting different aspects in each. The main focus of this photo, for me, was not just the placid, white duck but also the deep, gently agitated, green water it broods over. A tiny peace keeper surrounded by the chaos of Nature? Both these photos represent something similar to me. 

May: Jimi Hendrix Park, Seattle, WA | August 1 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/may-seattle-aug12021.jpg?raw=true "Heart of Jimi Hendrix Park")


June: Pike Place Market, Seattle, WA | June 29 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/june-seattle-jun292021.jpg?raw=true "Crowdsourcing")
Rachel's Ginger Beer is my favorite place to visit when I am in Seattle. I had a day for myself because all my friends were working that day. This is the only photo with signs of motion. Ginger beer is great for nursing heartbreak. 

July: Portage Bay, Seattle, WA | August 1 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/july-seattle-aug12021.jpg?raw=true "Houseboats")
I have always wanted to live on a houseboat. This might seem strange if you also knew that I was, and still am, to some extent, scared of deep water. I understand the appeal of living on a houseboat that wanders around. However, these were firmly rooted in place. I thought of how much I hate being woken up by the occassional quake in San Francisco and immediately readjusted my willingness to live on a houseboat. The reflections on the water more than made up for the dour sky. 

August: Japanese Hill and Pond Garden, Brooklyn, NY | November 11 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/august-nyc-nov112021.jpg.jpg?raw=true "Torii Pond")
The Japanese Hill and Pond garden in the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens features a near-perfect slice of Japan outside of Japan. I spent quite some time debating which photos to represent New York. I think this photo demonstrates the pockets of culture that New York is capable of replicating, almost like petri dish cultures, outside of their natural habitat. The vermilion-colored wooden torii overshadows a family photo session in the background. [more](https://www.bbg.org/collections/gardens/japanese_garden) 

September: San Francisco, CA | September 9 2020
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/september-sf-sept92020.jpg?raw=true "")
September 9, 2020 will forever go down in my personal history, at least, as "the day the sky turned red." A dubious epithet, a runaway filter from Blade Runner 2049 applied to reality, the closest thing to an acknowledgment that the dystopia is already here just unevenly distributed, take your pick. I am lucky enough to be able to blow off work for a day and also to have a friend who was willing to do the same. We had a good reason. 

October: Jane's Carousel & Skyline, Brooklyn, NY | November 9 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/october-nyc-nov92021.jpg?raw=true "New York")
On the way to Jane's Carousel, rectangular structure near the water, and past the famed DUMBO bridge viewpoint, you end up walking on a street with, as far as I can tell, no name. It is odd that this small, uneven, paved path has resisted naming in what is clearly a tourist infested area. I ate breakfast here in peace while only a few blocks away people clamored to take a photo of a bridge and two buildings. 

November: somewhere near Portage Bay, Seattle, WA | August 2 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/november1-seattle-aug22021.jpg?raw=true "Me")
I am not entirely sure when I clicked this photo but it is undoubtedly one of the last few from my Seattle trip. I thought this photo beautifully demonstrates my film camera's affinity to the color green. Also, I could not resist the tempation to include a little immutable me in the calendar. As Barthes says "I am the reference of every photograph."

November: Highway 140, Mariposa, CA | October 16 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/november2-yosemite-oct162021.jpg?raw=true "Red")
This car is in many ways a contradiction to the other photo. It is red while the previous photo is primarily green. It is a real tangible object while the shadow in the previous is just a representation of myself. It is perfection, in some ways, and I am not.

December: Chapel in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY | November 14 2021
![Cover Image](/imgs/2022calendar/december-nyc-nov142021.jpg.jpg?raw=true "Chapel")
Coming upon the chapel while walking in the Green-Wood cemetery was a breathtaking surprise. I am sure I looked around multiple times to make sure I wasn't the only one seeing it and also to make sure I could share my sense of wonder, "you seein' this shit?" I might have remarked if I was a New Yorker, with other human beings. The entire cemetery is a national historic landmark.
